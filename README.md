# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

Conway's game of life in Lua(LOVE2D). Haven't tried to include any optimisations of any form as of yet.

There are several improvements I plan on making, mainly to how I've written the update functions (getX location around point and processing) which will definately improve the effciency and the speed of the program once done. 

I also need to add the ability to 'draw' alive cells by using the mouse.
